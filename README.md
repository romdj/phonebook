### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository aims to show my abilities in doing a Full-Stack application using Node.JS (Express.js) and AngularJS (cdn, v1.5.6), Database is in MongoDB so mongoose package is used, tests are done using Jest and Jasmine but couldn't be implemented yet.

* v 1.0.0
* path: https://www.github.com/romdj/phonebook.git

### How do I get set up? ###

No JS compilers (such as webpack and babel) have been used, due to project's limited scope.
* You need to have a Node.JS client, and a MongoDB client running.
* To set up the environment, in both folders, enter the command `npm install`
* To start the RestAPI application, enter the command `npm start`.

As of now no config file are used but that would be the step after testing if a significant amount of configuration is involved
